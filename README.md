# New Features in @muzman/node-toolkit

### NATS Streaming Integration

@muzman/node-toolkit now includes support for NATS Streaming Server, providing a robust solution for event-based communication between microservices. Below are the newly added features regarding NATS:

**_Event Publishing_**

```javascript
import { Publisher } from "@muzman/node-toolkit";
import { Subjects } from "@muzman/node-toolkit";

// Specific event class
class MyEventPublisher extends Publisher<MyEvent> {
  subject: Subjects.MyEvent = Subjects.MyEvent;
}

// Usage
const publisher = new MyEventPublisher(natsClientInstance);

// Publish an event
publisher.publish({
  //...event data
});
```

**_Event Listening_**

```javascript
import { Listener } from "@muzman/node-toolkit";
import { Message } from "node-nats-streaming";
import { Subjects } from "@muzman/node-toolkit";

// Specific event class
class MyEventListener extends Listener<MyEvent> {
  subject: Subjects.MyEvent = Subjects.MyEvent;
  queueGroupName = "my-service-queue-group";

  onMessage(data: MyEvent["data"], msg: Message) {
    console.log(`Event data: `, data);

    // ...handle the event

    // Acknowledge that we received the message
    msg.ack();
  }
}

// Usage
const listener = new MyEventListener(natsClientInstance);
listener.listen();
```

### Advanced Types Usage

To enhance the development experience, @muzman/node-toolkit introduces a sophisticated system for handling types, making it easier to manage and validate data structures in your applications.

Usage of Types
With the new feature, you can import various predefined types from the framework, enhancing consistency, and reliability in your codebase.

```javascript
import { UserAttrs } from "@muzman/node-toolkit";

// Use the types in your application logic
const userData: UserAttrs = {
  // ... your user data fields
};
```

### Comprehensive Usage Guide

After installing the @muzman/node-toolkit, you can utilize its features within your application. Here's how you can use each part of the framework:

1-Auth Middleware (requireAuth): This middleware function is used to verify the authentication of users. If the token is valid, it allows the request to proceed; otherwise, it responds with an error.

```javascript
import { requireAuth } from "@muzman/node-toolkit";

// Protect your routes with requireAuth
app.use("/protected-route", requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  // Your code here. This will run after successful authentication.
});
```

2-Error Handling (errorHandler): This function handles errors within your application. You can customize the status code and the message returned to the client.

```javascript
import { errorHandler } from "@muzman/node-toolkit";

// Usage in your Express error-handling middleware.
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // Customize the status code and message as per your requirements.
  errorHandler(req, res, "Custom error message", 500);
});
```

3-Result Handling (resultHandler): This function allows you to standardize the response you send from your API routes, ensuring you maintain consistency throughout your application.

```javascript
import { resultHandler } from "@muzman/node-toolkit";

app.get("/some-route", (req, res) => {
  // You can customize the payload and status code for the response.
  resultHandler(req, res, { data: "This is the response data." }, 200);
});
```

These are the core functionalities provided by @muzman/node-toolkit. By integrating this into your application, you ensure streamlined error handling, response management, and secure routes with authentication.
